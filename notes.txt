============== Notes for Vidjot Project ==============
======================================================

Node - Express - MongoDB 

============== MongoDB ==============
starting up MongoDB locally

in terminal window 

first time
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo.exe"

access local mongeDB 
cd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin

mongo

show dbs
use vidjot-dev
show collections
db.ideas.find()


============== Create package.json  ==============
generate package.json - contains list of dependencies and versions use

---- in terminal 
npm init

============== Install Express ==============
install express and its dependencies

---- in terminal 

npm install --save express 

============== Entry point ==============
default scenario uses index.js but we are using app.js for this Project

============== nodemon ==============
npm install -g nodemon

npm root -g // finds folder where global modules are put

---- in terminal start with
nodemon


======================================================
============== Middleware ==============


Using middleware
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal 
functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series 
of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object 
(req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the 
applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly 
denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, 
the request will be left hanging.


======================================================
============== Handlebars ==============
middleware

template engine - to render html and js expressions on the screen from the
 server. You can use this instead of react or some other front-end framework. We 
 are using it in this project for simplicity.

npm install express-handlebars --save

to see these templates you need to make a views directory and also make a directory 
that contains main.js which is a view that wraps all other views.

you can also have a dir called partials. We are using a partial to render the navbar 


======================================================
============== Mongoose ==============


npm install --save mongoose

============== body-parser.js ==============
middleware
Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before 
your handlers, available under the req.body property.

npm install --save body-parser

============== method-overried ==============
middleware
Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where 
the client doesn't support it. In other words you can use it to change the 
method of a <form> element depending on what you want to use the form for.
You could change "post" to "get" for example

This is useful if you don't want to write extra code to make an ajax request

npm install --save method-override

  <form action="/ideas/{{idea.id}}?_method=PUT" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">

============== Express Session ==============
middleware

npm install --save session

============== Connect Flash ==============
middleware

basically this allows us to pop up a message when a user has triggered an event 
such as editing or deleting 

npm install --save connect-flash

============== Passport ==============
middleware

User Authentication

npm install Passport

1) create a login route and login form, (also create registration route and form)
2) function call for chosen strategy - examples: local, google oauth, facebook etc
3)  strategy must be brought into app and defined
  Local Strategy
  a. look for user, if user found
  b. validate password
  c. if password found return done()
  d. user is logged in

============== Express Router ==============
allows you to group routes together in a file/module and import them into main.
This will keep your main file from being so long and cluttered.

in app.js a route looks like this:

app.get("/ideas/add", (req, res) => {
  res.render("ideas/add");
});

when you put it in a module you need to change app to router since we are exporting 
router. You also need to delete the portion of the url that is the same as the module name
In the example below notice that "/ideas/add" is changed to "/add". the /ideas portion 
will be added in automatically as part of the export. Also, remember to bring in and mongoose 
models that the  routes will need.

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Load Idea Model
require("./models/Idea");
const Idea = mongoose.model("ideas");

router.get("/add", (req, res) => {
  res.render("ideas/add");
});

module.exports = router;

----app.js

const ideas = require('./routes/ideas');

// use routes - anything that goes to /ideas/ANYTHING will go and use the 
ideas file to find the route

app.use('/ideas', ideas);
